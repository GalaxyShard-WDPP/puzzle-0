            Shown above is a digital copy of the original QR code.
            The computer accidentally read the code incorrectly! It thought that one of the pixels (bits) had been white (0) instead of black (1), resulting in a part of the link changing.
            In order to interpret the original message, it will need to be manually fixed.<br><span class="vital">Use the following information to fix the website link</span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The letter that was changed by the QR scanner should have been equal to the lowest letter, in the opposite order of the alphabet, found in the first half of the link.<br>
            Instead, the scanner replaced that letter with the one just before the correct letter.<br>
            <br>
            The exact pixel that was interpreted incorrectly was in the 17th column from the bottom left. This is near the end of the message.
